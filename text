What is SIM808 module?
-We usually used a series of SIM modules for sending and receiving SMS, making calls, using GPRS, etc., but the SIM808 module has a special feature and that is GPS receiver. This feature makes this module very useful for making all kinds of trackers.  


-SIM808 module uses serial communication protocol to interface with Arduino
TX: Transmitting Data
RX: Receiving Data
VIN: Input voltage (this pin is connected to the jack plug, and if the adapter is connected, no power needs to be supplied here.)
GND: Ground


Hardware Component 
*Arduino Uno 
*SIM 808 Module 
*12V 5A powe Adapter 
*Male to Female jumper wire
*SIM Card

SoftWare   
Arduino IDE
SIM808 library "DFRobot_SIM808"
ArduinoJson //for sending request in json formate 


in code we us AT command  AT commands to write the code for the car tracking system ; Like make call or send message or make 
freatur in Sim808

-One full modem serial port (UART interface)
-Audio channels, which include a microphone input and a receiver output
-One SIM card interface
-Ability to support 4*4keypads by default
-A charging interface
-One USB, which supports debug and firmware upgrading
-Ability to support Bluetooth function
-Integrated TCP/IP protocol and extended TCP/IP AT commands, which are very useful for data transfer applications
-Ability to support GPS function
-A power-saving technique the keeps the current consumption is as low as 1.2mA in sleep mode (with GPS engine powered down)
